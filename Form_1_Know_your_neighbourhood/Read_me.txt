Follow these, and code will run on web using your own web space!
Have folllowed orignal directory structurein github too. 
Relative referencing is used, so there would be no need to change references anywhere. 
Open your M drive, go inside web folder, paste oracle file inside it (file oracle should be ouside public_html in the same way as it is here in (github))
All the contents inside public_html directory of github must go inside public_html folder in your M drive (Ctrl A + Ctrl C here and Ctrl V there)
