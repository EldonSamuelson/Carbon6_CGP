Updated Form page iframe templates to be the correct size, somewhat centered information, and in the correct fonts. The styling code is all over the place, but mostly hardcoded (i.e. iframe htmls) or split between the FORMPAGE.html and FORMPAGE.css. It all works and looks right for now, but it will be a nightmare documenting. Sorry!
