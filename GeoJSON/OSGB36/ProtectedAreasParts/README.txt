These 4 files form the basis of "Protected Areas New", to get
around the projection/clipping issue we had with the initial PA.

I also converted these in case we ant to add them to the webmap, as
the constituent parts can tell us more about certain protections
certain areas have, as it isn't all specifically about trees or greenspace.
