In here, we have:

- EDI Merged: The new EDI with merged districts to match the records we have in the Forms for the webmap,
with all the correct statistics and stuff.

- EDI Non Merged: The EDI as we originally had it in the presentation and report. 
Not to be used in the Forms.

- FW Greenspaces: The Fieldwork selected greenspaces from the report/earlier. Not much more to say.

- NFI11_18: The National Forest Inventory change(Ha) 2011-18 shapefile, as from the report.

- Open Space Audit 2016: From Edinburgh council, their audit of all greenspaces
from 2016 as well as their conditions environmentally, and "greenspacieness". It's
the most recent Audit as the next is in 2021!

- Protected Areas New: This is a new shapefile to corect the incorrectable projection
issues, and includes 4 constituent parts as listed and explained in the 
"PA New Constituents" folder. Read the README in the folder!
