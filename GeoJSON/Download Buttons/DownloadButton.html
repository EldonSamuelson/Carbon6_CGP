These download buttons allow for users of the map to import the entire GeoJSONs to their computer for personal use. The files that are available are either sourced originally from publically available data online (Edinburgh Council, The Forestry Commssion, etc), or made/modified by our group (Group 6) which we are allowing to be made available.
