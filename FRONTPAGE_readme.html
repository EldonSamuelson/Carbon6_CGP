The front page will act as the index/landing page for the entire map and data website. The only interactive elements (apart from scrolling) are the navigation bar and the button that takes you to the map page.
	
This page requires only HTML, CSS, and jquery for the lightboxes. 
	
Some of the structure and visual concepts for the page were inspired by Soils Revealed' website (Vizzuality 2020) and repurposed from Adobe's library via Dreamweaver (Adobe 2020).

Google fonts is used throughout the website from the front page (Google 2021) in order to maintain online based font formatting.

Images for this page are either clipart, our map products or images acquired from online sources and will be referenced properly in the case of the latter. 

The hover over buttons are a simple html utility that is understood by all browsers in versions of html that are currently in use. They require a cursor hover over to be activated. 

All objects are structured in grid/column/row style and an effort has been made to make position relative and absolute where appropriate in order to increase operability across small screens and alternative media platforms. 

The text largely gives context and narrative to the utility behind our implementation decisions on the later pages, as well as creating a hypothetical company that will present this website, and supply mapping products to local authorities. This is with the aim of storing their data visually and automatically guiding them to increase their carbon sequestration capacity. 

For this, a modern looking website was required, and all design implementations reflect this, from full page banners to grid-centre and off centre text where appropriate (Skarlatidou et al 2013).
	
Care was also taken that the brand of the company/website had to be clear. This is why a simple logo was pushed on all pages in the same place and the name of the company was clearly displayed on the landing page.

Similarly, the navigation away from the page was held at the top and the bottom. This was to ensure users could begin to access the data interface after they had read the context, but also access it easily from the landing page if they had visited previously.
