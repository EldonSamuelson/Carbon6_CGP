We provide spatial representation of the carbon storage potential for each zone in Edinburgh through our Envronmental Deprivation Index (ADD LINK).
The zones with high environmental deprivation scored lowest on our index (EDI rank: 0).
We identified areas around Leith (North-east Edinburgh) to be most environmentally deprived and 
least environmentally deprived areas include Cramond, Corstophine and Colinton.
There is however no prominent correlation between social deprivation and environmental deprivation.
We provide access to detailed socio-environmental statistics pertaining to each zone and assistance to formulate an action plan to improve the EDI rank for a specific zone resulting in enhanced carbon sequestration.
