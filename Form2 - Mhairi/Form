Entitled: Steps in improve carbon sequesteration
This form uses a python script () to take the input zone area and user selected target for the zone to reach and calculates which variables are required to improve.
An SQL database stores attributes of factors used to create the EDI. This includes zone specific values and 

Various steps taken to improve the EDI include:
Increasing tree and juvenile count 
Increase species diversity
Change medium carbon sequestering land cover to high carbon sequestering land cover which has a greater contribution per hectare than medium.
Finally, woodland is required to be created.

These steps are interrelated to provide a more realistic representation however it is recognised that tree growth and structure is complex so many assumptions are required.
Assumptions include:
50% of woodland is high carbon land cover, and the other 50% is medium.
Population per hectare is not changed as it is not practical for planners to reduce population.
DBH is also not included because when trees are initially planted they will not be large enough to be counted as trees (DBH>7cm)
Complex growth rates for this long term plan also complicate calculating changes in DBH so it is assumed to be constant.

Throughout the code, variables are assigned to be used to form the output. 
These assigned variables are processed to calulate the increases required for each EDI component.
Sentances are then formed using the relavent assigned variables where strings are formatted with the calculated values.
Since each calcualtion will not require increases to each variable, there are many different output options.
The formatted strings are then assigned to variables to be used in jinga2 templates.
The various output options results in some strings being repeated.
This was necessary as initially strings were joined together which caused a tuple to form, containing commas which would later need removed for printing in the template.

Three templates have been used to ensure there is always an output:
()If either of the form inputs have not been selected, a message appears to encourage the user to input correct values.
()If the target EDI selected is lower than the current EDI for the zone selected, further improvements are suggested.
()Otherwise, 3 different steps are suggested to increase the EDI.

From the users point-of-view, they are required to input selections into two drop-down menus.

Aerial Imagery lightbox
These are all jpegs due to the complexity of ensuring transparency in the backgrounds for aerial images.
It was therefore more suitable to create static images since no interactivity was required in these pages.
