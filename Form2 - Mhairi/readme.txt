Follow these strictly, to enable code to run on web using your own web space/directory!
I have folllowed orignal directory structure in github too, so it should be copy and paste (to save time for everyone). 
Relative referencing is used, so there would be no need to change references anywhere. 
Open your M drive, go inside web folder, paste oracle file inside it (file oracle should be ouside public_html in the same way as it is here in (github))
All the contents inside public_html directory of github must go inside public_html folder in your M drive (Ctrl A + Ctrl C here and Ctrl V there)
Working link just for reference sake https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s2041305/form1.html (after u have placed everything in your directory, replace sxxxxxxx with your id) )
Documentation on working/technology used will be uploaded in due course
For edipredictformatting.html, you need a folder within public_html called CGS containing the photos then update the link in the html file to your studentID.
Images will need chnaged once final aesthetics are confirmed.
Formatting files are not yet using CSS (styling only in head).
