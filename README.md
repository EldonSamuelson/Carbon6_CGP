# Carbon6_CGP
"A place to store, edit and look out for each other's work. Languages here include python, html, javascript and some other stuff to knit the whole thing together."

This is a cloned copy of the original Edinburgh Carbon Greenspaces Project (CGP) undertaken as part of the Universtiy of Edinburgh's GIS MSc First Semester courses between October 2020 and January 2021. This was backed up here to my personal account to allow for future access, should the University account on Gitlab be restricted. It acts as a proof of concept and display of our work.

This was a team project comprised of Chandramauli, James Tomlinson, Mark Vallely, Mhairi Walker, myself (SÃ©amus O'Donnell), and Qiyao Xiao.

While this repository contains the raw files, it also has complete working file structures packed in .zips (i.e. Version #10) to display a multipage website, complete with webmaps and 
database querying functions.

A final complete example (Version ##11) can be explored at: 
https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s1624036/FRONTPAGE.html

Should the above link expire (as it is on the University's server), a slightly less functional archive (lacking python and javascript) can be found at: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20210704113936/https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s1624036/FRONTPAGE.html

All data used was open access and attributed to their respective authors (Edinburgh City Council, Scottish Forestry Commission, ESA), however in the unlikely event that someone finds this useful, please cite the work as:
