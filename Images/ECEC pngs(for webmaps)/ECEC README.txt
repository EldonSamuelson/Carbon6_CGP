There are 2 of each image:

ECEC 100K Low Grey: Used as a legend, as if this is going to put into the leaflet map the legend can't be added seperately from the image, but to be used as a reference. DO NOT USE FOR MAP
ECEC 100K Orange: Similar as above (DON'T USE FOR MAP), this puts the low category in light orange, if we want to include that.

THE ACTUAL MAP IMAGES - USE THESE!
ECEC 80K Low Grey - In PNG to support a transparent background and keep the filesize low, this is the best resolution image available at lowest scale (at <1:70,000 you start to see pixelation). Simply crop out the border, and you're away. IF JPEG is specifically needed for leaflet mapping, whatsapp me and I'll make a new copy, but JPEG's WILL have a white background.
ECEC 80K Orange - Same as above, but with Low as orange. Simply crop out the border, and you're away. IF JPEG is specifically needed for leaflet mapping, whatsapp me and I'll make a new copy, but JPEG's WILL have a white background.
